Optimal solar panels installation is complex. Traditional analysis is inefficient; current automated tools often lack broad accuracy or scalability. This projects explores neural networks for scalable solar farm site prediction. We have used   CNNs to classify land cover and LSTM to forecast land costs. With this project, we aim to improve solar planning, facilitate increased utilization of renewable energy sources, and demonstrate the significant potential of AI in optimizing spatial resource allocation.

To run the inference system unzip the `inference_engine.zip` in a GoogleDrive folder. After unzipping adjust the relative paths inside `inference.ipynb` and `Price_prediction.ipynb`.

Set the coordinates and the year inside the main and run the code.
